# Architect Contributor Metadata
  
## Assigned to:
- github_user

## Description
This is an architecture story. Design and document how to store meta data about _who_ is contributing and to _which_ data records.
  

## Requirements

### Objectives

- Design and document a schema such that the system will thoroughly and efficiently track who has contributed to each cononical record, and which data they contributed.
- This may eventually tie into permissions and roles for access as well. Good idea or no?
- As much as possible this should be efficient to run. Considerations may include whether to store data in nested JSON (PostGRES) or in tables, the cost of join tables, etc.

### Constraints
Make a list of the limitations/things the code can _not_ do.
- 

## Resources
Insert all the materials needed to complete this code.
- name (url)

## Documentation Protocol
First, include a readme that describes what your code does and explains difficult bits.

Second, use descriptive variables and method names so that the code is readable and obvious.

Third, comment each function or method along with inputs and returns, and use other inline comments to make particularly opaque or unavoidably clever code clear.

A story is absolutely __not__ complete until time has been spent at the end revewing, updating, and tidying up documentation.
