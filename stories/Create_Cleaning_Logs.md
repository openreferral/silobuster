# Create Reports

## Description

Log data about deuplicate records generated by the "cleaning" steps.

## Requirements

### Objectives

- Create Log table if it doesn't already exist.
- Wire up the ability to export logs from the various cleaning steps.

Reference the supplemental story "Defining_Logs.md" for the shape of log data.

### Constraints

- N/A

## Resources

Reference the supplemental story "Defining_Logs.md" for the shape of log data.

## Documentation Protocol
First, include a readme that describes what your code does and explains difficult bits.

Second, use descriptive variables and method names so that the code is readable and obvious.

Third, comment each function or method along with inputs and returns, and use other inline comments to make particularly opaque or unavoidably clever code clear.

A story is absolutely __not__ complete until time has been spent at the end revewing, updating, and tidying up documentation.
