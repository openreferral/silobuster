These three steps (outlined here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1iV_RWk37NtC5cCjCrL8UJdJwlpQIiL-Gbr6jXoYjMoI/edit#slide=id.gfcdcaee185_0_1) may be separate processes in future Airflow implementations, but for this event we are starting with our data already loaded, transformed, and ready to go.

Loading has been done using Fivetran (we might recommend using open source Airbyte for future projects). Transformation with DBT, which also includes the ability to validate as models are created.
