# project_name SOW


## Assigned to:
- github_user

## Description
Describe the problem being solved. Provide context for how it will fit into the larger project. Establish purpose.

## Requirements

### Objectives
Make a bullet list of the things that the code must do.
- 

### Constraints
Make a list of the limitations/things the code can _not_ do.
- 

## Resources
Insert all the materials needed to complete this code.
- name (url)

## Documentation Protocol
First, include a readme that describes what your code does and explains difficult bits.

Second, use descriptive variables and method names so that the code is readable and obvious.

Third, comment each function or method along with inputs and returns, and use other inline comments to make particularly opaque or unavoidably clever code clear.

A story is absolutely __not__ complete until time has been spent at the end revewing, updating, and tidying up documentation.
